SUCCESS! All processes are done.
Now - increase the task duration (representing 
      the time the task has the database 
      tied up during an insert statement).
How well do the multiple, concurrent processes share a database 
when each task can take more time? 
How can we let multiple processes share a resource
without interfering with each other?
